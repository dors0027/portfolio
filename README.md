In the final assignment of the first semester, I made the mistake of working on the bigger screen size first, so this time I made sure of starting small, and then going large. I started with the 'home' page, then the 'about' page, then 'contact' page and finally the 'sent' page. I grew to like coding way more than I thought I would and found this assignment pretty simple, after practicing a lot on my own. I think what I had trouble most with was validating the code because it got confusing, especially since I waited til I was finished and had to validate everything all at once. Some things I didn't understand or know so I had to use google to find the answers. For example, the validator told me I had to add a 'sizes' attribute in the index.html where the images are optimized, and I hadn't used or know about that one.

Here's the links to the resources I used (I only used bootstrap, everything else is mine/made by me):

Navigation Bar: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/#offcanvas
Carousel: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel/#basic-examples
Contact Form: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/form-control/#example

Also, I would like to thank you for the 2 semesters. I learned a lot and now I actually like coding. I thought I would hate it, but now my best grades are in web development. Thank you.
